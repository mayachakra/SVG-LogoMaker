# Object-oriented Programming Challenge: SVG Logo Maker

## User Story
```
AS a freelance web developer
I WANT to generate a simple logo for my projects
SO THAT I don't have to pay a graphic designer
```
## Acceptance Criteria
This program follows the acceptance criteria of:
```
GIVEN a command-line application that accepts user input
WHEN I am prompted for text
THEN I can enter up to three characters
WHEN I am prompted for the text color
THEN I can enter a color keyword (OR a hexadecimal number)
WHEN I am prompted for a shape
THEN I am presented with a list of shapes to choose from: circle, triangle, and square
WHEN I am prompted for the shape's color
THEN I can enter a color keyword (OR a hexadecimal number)
WHEN I have entered input for all the prompts
THEN an SVG file is created named `logo.svg`
AND the output text "Generated logo.svg" is printed in the command line
WHEN I open the `logo.svg` file in a browser
THEN I am shown a 300x200 pixel image that matches the criteria I entered
```

## Description
For this assignment I created a shapes class with shapes such as a Circle, Triangle, and a Square and an index.js file so the user may be prompted with questions on the CLI to
input their logo text, a color for the text, a shape through a dropdown selection, and the color for the shape. Once this is entered a logo.svg is created with the logo selections
based on the user.
